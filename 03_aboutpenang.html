                <h2>Before 15th Century</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Before Penang obtained its own government, it was part of the state of Kedah, which 
                    played a significant role in Malaysian history as an important Indian center of influence and trade. Indian merchants 
                    arrived in Peninsular Malaysia before the 1st century, bringing with them herbs, spices, gold, Buddhism, and Hinduism. 
                    In the 9th century, Muslim merchants from India and the Middle East arrived, primarily for trade, and played a key role 
                    in spreading Islam in the region.</p></br>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Chinese merchants discovered Penang in the 15th century, charting the island, 
                    which was later named Penang, meaning areca nut in Malaysia's native language. China became an important trading partner 
                    through the command of Admiral Cheng Ho, exchanging goods, materials, and techniques with Penang and the rest of the 
                    Malaysian peninsula.</p></br>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the 14th century, European merchants, starting with the Portuguese, made their 
                    way to Penang, maintaining a monopoly in Southeast Asia by keeping their maps secret. The Dutch arrived in 1595, followed 
                    by the English. Francis Light, an Englishman, persuaded the Sultan of Kedah to hand over Penang to the British East India 
                    Company. Light founded Georgetown and cleared the dense jungle using a cannon filled with silver coins to motivate 
                    laborers. Penang became a prominent trading destination known as the "Pearl of the Orient."</p>
                </div>
            
            <div class="section-content strategy">
                <h2>16th Century</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the 16th century, Penang's history began with the arrival of Portuguese 
                    merchants from Goa, India, who were sailing to the Far East in search of spices. They stopped at a small rocky islet 
                    on the northern coast of Penang to obtain fresh water from a nearby river. The locals referred to these Portuguese 
                    traders as "ferringi." Over time, this rocky islet became known as Batu Ferringhi or Lover's Isle.</p></br>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Portuguese named the main island "Pulo Pinaom," which translates to Betel Nut 
                    Island. Later, the name evolved to Penang, meaning "palm tree," possibly due to the abundance of areca nut palm trees in 
                    the area.</p></br>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;During the 16th century, Penang served as a natural harbor for ships from Arabia, 
                    China, the Dutch Republic, France, and India. It gained popularity among pirates who targeted vessels passing through 
                    the Straits of Malacca. The spice and opium trade between the East and West also flourished during this time.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section-content creative">
                <h2>17th century</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the 17th century, Penang became a vital natural harbor during the monsoon 
                    months for various ships, including those from Arabian, Chinese, Dutch, French, and Indian origins. However, it also 
                    attracted the attention of pirates who targeted ships passing through the Straits of Malacca. During this period, both 
                    the Dutch and the British sought to dominate the spice trade in the region.</p></br>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Captain Francis Light, representing the British, arrived in Penang to establish trade 
                    relations. Despite Penang being under the control of the Kingdom of Kedah, the Sultan of Kedah handed over the island to Light 
                    in 1771 in exchange for protection against neighboring threats. Light sailed to Junk Ceylon to establish a business, gaining 
                    valuable knowledge of local customs and language, which helped him gain the trust of the people.</p></br>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In August 1786, Light officially took possession of the island and renamed it 
                    Prince of Wales Island. He established a settlement on the northeast peninsula, naming it George Town in honor of the 
                    Prince of Wales, who later became King George IV. The population of the previously uninhabited area rapidly grew to 
                    10,000 by the end of the century. Prince of Wales Island flourished as a trading post for various goods, including tea, 
                    cloves, pepper, nutmeg, and textiles.</p></br>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Meanwhile, Sultan Abdullah of the Sultanate of Kedah, realizing that the British 
                    were not providing the protection he sought, gathered an army to retake Penang. However, Kedah was defeated, and Sultan 
                    Abdullah entered into a contract with the British, handing over Penang. In return, Light agreed to pay an annual sum of 
                    6,000 Spanish dollars to the Sultan. This arrangement continues today, with the Penang Government paying RM 18,800 to the 
                    Sultan of Kedah each year. Following Francis Light's death in 1794, his position was taken over by Martina Rozells and 
                    William Light.</p>

                <h2>18th & 19th Century</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;During the 18th century, Penang witnessed the cultivation of various 
                    agricultural crops. The fertile land allowed for the cultivation of spices, including pepper, nutmeg, and cloves. 
                    These crops contributed to Penang's economic growth and established it as an agricultural center.</p></br>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1826, Penang, along with Malacca and Singapore, was incorporated into 
                    the Straits Settlements, a British administrative unit. This consolidation further strengthened British control 
                    over the region and fostered administrative and economic cooperation among the three settlements.</p></br>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the 19th century, Penang experienced significant developments that solidified 
                    its position as a British colonial settlement and prosperous trading port. The incorporation into the Straits 
                    Settlements in 1826 strengthened British control and fostered administrative cooperation. The influx of Chinese 
                    immigrants played a crucial role in Penang's economic growth, while infrastructure development improved connectivity 
                    and facilitated trade. The island's economy thrived through trade in commodities such as spices, tea, and tin, and the 
                    cultivation of crops like pepper, nutmeg, and cloves. Penang's multicultural society continued to flourish, showcasing 
                    the influences of Chinese, Malay, Indian, and European cultures. The establishment of Penang Free School in 1816 
                    contributed to educational advancement. </p>

                    spaces and eco-friendly practices. Penang embraced smart city initiatives, utilizing technology to improve urban
