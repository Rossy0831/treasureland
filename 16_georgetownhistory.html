					<h3>Establishment</h3>
					<p>
                        In the 1770s, Captain Francis Light was sent by the British East India Company to establish trade relations in the 
                        Malay Peninsula. He formed a friendly alliance with the Sultan of Kedah and secured the offer of Penang Island for 
                        the British in exchange for military assistance. In 1786, Light arrived on Penang Island and established the 
                        settlement of George Town. He developed it as a free port, attracting traders by offering tax exemptions. The 
                        port quickly grew, and by 1792, the population had reached 10,000. George Town became an important trading hub 
                        in the region. The establishment of a local council and a Supreme Court followed in the early 19th century.</p>

					<h3>Colonial era</h3>
					<p>
                        In the early 19th century, Penang Island became a thriving center for spice production and trade. Its Port of 
                        Penang facilitated the export of spices like nutmeg, clove, and pepper. This trade helped cover administrative 
                        costs for the British East India Company. George Town, the capital of the Straits Settlements, played a vital 
                        role in the region's commerce. The city's significance grew further with the emergence of the tin-exporting 
                        industry, attracting prominent financial institutions. George Town became a leading financial hub in Malaya, 
                        benefiting from the opening of the Suez Canal and the rise of steamships.</p>

					<p>George Town's population grew rapidly and became diverse, with Chinese, Malay, Indian, Peranakan, Eurasian, and 
                        Thai communities. However, this growth led to social challenges such as sanitation issues, public health concerns, 
                        and increased crime rates. In 1867, the Penang Riots occurred, but under British rule, law enforcement improved 
                        and secret societies were gradually banned. George Town made advancements in healthcare, public transportation, 
                        and education. The city became known for its intellectual openness, attracting notable figures. Overall, George 
                        Town experienced economic growth, cultural diversity, and improvements in governance and infrastructure, 
                        establishing itself as a prominent city in the region.</p>

					<h3>World Wars</h3>
					<p>During World War I, the Battle of Penang took place as the German cruiser SMS Emden sank two Allied warships 
                        off the coast of George Town, resulting in the deaths of 147 French and Russian sailors. It was the only World 
                        War I engagement on Malayan territory.In World War II, George Town faced significant upheaval. Japanese warplanes 
                        bombed the city, destroying Allied air squadrons and prompting the withdrawal of British forces. The British 
                        secretly evacuated the European population, leading some historians to believe that the loss of Penang 
                        undermined British invincibility. </p>

					<p>George Town fell to the Imperial Japanese Army, and the occupation was marked by massacres of the Chinese 
                        population and the coercion of women into becoming comfort women.George Town's harbor facilities became a 
                        major U-boat base for Nazi Germany, and the Port of Penang was used by submarines of various forces. 
                        Allied bombers targeted George Town, damaging colonial buildings and mining the Penang Strait to impede 
                        Japanese shipping. After the Japanese surrender, the British Royal Marines accepted the surrender of the 
                        Japanese garrison, and Penang Island was retaken under Operation Jurist.</p>

					<h3>Post-war</h3>
					<p>After the Straits Settlements was dissolved, Penang merged with the Malayan Union and later became part of the 
                        Federation of Malaya. Concerns over economic and ethnic issues arose among the population. The Penang 
                        Secessionist Committee was formed but eventually disbanded due to British opposition. In response, 
                        the British government guaranteed George Town's free port status and reintroduced municipal elections. 
                        In 1957, George Town was granted city status, becoming the first city in the Federation of Malaya and 
                        Malaysia. This period marked significant political changes for Penang within the larger context of 
                        Malaya and Malaysia.</p>

					<h3>Post-independence</h3>
					<p>In the late 1960s, George Town lost its free port status, resulting in high unemployment. This led to a period 
                        of decline lasting until the early 2000s, with the city experiencing a brain drain. Efforts to revitalize the 
                        city through the Komtar project in 1974 had limited success. In the same year, the George Town City Council 
                        merged with the Penang Island Rural District Council, sparking a long-standing debate about the city's status.</p>

					<h3>Renaissance</h3>
					<p>
                        In the early 2000s, George Town experienced a continued decline due to the repeal of the Rent Control Act, which 
                        led to the deterioration of historical buildings and the exodus of residents from the city center. Poor urban 
                        planning, traffic congestion, and brain drain further contributed to the city's challenges. However, public 
                        support and partnerships emerged to conserve historic buildings and restore the city's former glory. In 2008, 
                        George Town was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, leading to efforts to improve the city's cleanliness, 
                        traffic flow, and overall livability. These initiatives, along with increased private sector investment, helped 
                        boost the city's services sector and attracted foreign investors. Despite facing setbacks such as the Indian 
                        Ocean tsunami in 2004, George Town's status as a city was expanded to encompass the entire Penang Island in 
                        2015 by the Malaysian federal government.</p>
