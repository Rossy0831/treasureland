                    <p>The currency in Penang, Malaysia, is the Malaysian Ringgit (MYR). Cash is widely accepted, and there are ATMs available

                        as shopping malls and restaurants are often air-conditioned. For formal occasions, men can wear western-style suits 
                        or batik shirts, but it's best to confirm the dress code with the event organizer. Modest attire is necessary when 
                        visiting places of worship, and mosques usually provide appropriate cover-ups for tourists. Remember to remove your 
                        shoes when entering religious sites.</p> 
    
                    <p>It's recommended to carry a compact umbrella when engaging in outdoor activities in Penang, and it's important to

                        <p>Penang celebrates the national holidays of Malaysia, which include:</p>    
                        <p>1. New Year's Day (1st January): Celebrated as the beginning of the Gregorian calendar year, it is a 
                            public holiday in Penang and throughout Malaysia.</p>          
                        <p>2. Chinese New Year: This is a significant celebration for the Chinese community in Penang. The date varies each 
                            year but usually falls in January or February. It is marked by vibrant decorations, lion and dragon dances, 
                            fireworks, and family gatherings.</p>  
                        <p>3. Hari Raya Aidilfitri: Also known as Eid al-Fitr, this Muslim festival marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy 
                            month of fasting. It is a joyous celebration of feasting, visiting relatives, and seeking forgiveness. The date 
                            varies based on the Islamic lunar calendar.</p>   
                        <p>4. Hari Merdeka (Independence Day - 31st August): This national holiday commemorates Malaysia's independence 
                            from British colonial rule in 1957. Celebrations include parades, cultural performances, and patriotic events.</p> 
                        <p>5. Malaysia Day (16th September): Malaysia Day commemorates the formation of Malaysia in 1963 when Peninsular 
                            Malaysia, Sabah, Sarawak, and Singapore joined together (Singapore later left the federation). It is a day to 
                            celebrate the unity and diversity of the country.</p>      
                        <p>In addition to these national holidays, Penang also observes major cultural and religious celebrations such as 
                            Thaipusam (Hindu festival), Wesak Day (Buddhist festival), and Deepavali (Festival of Lights). These celebrations 
                            are marked by religious ceremonies, processions, and cultural performances.</p>  
                        <p>It's important to note that dates for specific festivals may vary each year based on the lunar calendar, so it's 
                            advisable to check the exact dates for these celebrations when planning your visit to Penang.</p>
