                    <p>Teochew puppetry and opera, once popularly performed during the Hungry Ghost Festival, are gradually being 
                        replaced by modern song and dance, as the public's interest in the traditional art form wanes. However, 
                        performer Ling Goh remains resolute in her mission to preserve and uphold this fading cultural heritage.</p></br>

                    <p>During her childhood, Ling Goh fondly recalls observing her mother getting dressed in magnificent costumes, 
                        adorning elaborate headgear, and applying intricate makeup before taking the stage to perform in front of 
                        an enthusiastic audience. Behind the scenes, the backstage area became her playground and classroom, where 
                        she immersed herself in the art of manipulating iron-rod puppets with skill and delved into understanding 
                        the subtle nuances of each character in Teochew opera.</p></br>

                        <p>Ling Goh, daughter of Toh Ai Hwa, founder of the Kim Giak Low Choon Puppet Troupe, comes from a lineage of 
                            Teochew opera performers spanning back to the 19th century. Teochew puppetry originated as two-dimensional 
                            shadow puppets in China, similar to local wayang kulit, using dried leather strips controlled by three long 
                            iron rods. During the Southern Song period, the art was brought to Chaoshan by refugees, where it evolved 
                            into three-dimensional iron-rod puppets. These Teochew puppets paved the way for the development of Teochew 
                            opera. The puppet performers wanted to embody the larger-than-life characters, moving beyond simply 
                            manipulating the puppets with their hands.</p></br>

                        <figcaption>Teochew three-dimensional puppets. Each Teochew puppet is manipulated by a puppeteer using three iron rods.</figcaption>

                        <p>Ling Goh explains that classic Teochew opera incorporates stories from popular local legends, including 
                            romantic tales and ghost stories from the Ming, Tang, and Qing dynasties. The opera is characterized by 
                            its grand costumes and elaborate stage make-up, which are essential elements of the performance. The 
                            make-up enhances facial expressions and allows the audience to fully immerse themselves in the opera 
                            experience. The elaborate headgear and extravagant dresses are designed to create visually captivating 
                            scenes and heighten the audience's visual experience.</p></br>

                        <p>In Teochew opera, female characters such as the Tragic Woman, Noblewoman, Maidservant, Valkyrie, Old Woman, 
                            and Matchmaker can be recognized by the scalloped hairline on their foreheads. On the other hand, male 
                            characters consist of the Young Man, Old Man, Fighter, and Comic. The Fool character adds comedic elements 
                            to the story, with male Fools distinguished by a distinctive white patch around the eyes and nose, while 
                            female Fools use make-up to exaggerate their features for humorous effect.</p></br>

                            <p>In recent years, there has been a decline in interest towards Teochew opera, which Ling Goh believes 
                                is due to misconceptions that it is solely performed for gods and ghosts. However, she emphasizes 
                                that Teochew opera has always been intended for human audiences. She observes that modern entertainment 
                                from Western, Korean, and Japanese cultures has captured people's attention, leading them to perceive 
                                Teochew opera as outdated (lau beh). Unfortunately, many lack the patience and willingness to learn and 
                                appreciate the cultural values embedded within Teochew opera.</p></br>

                            <p>Additionally, Ling Goh points out that the practice of temples hiring contemporary singers instead of 
                                traditional performers has further contributed to the diminishing interest in Teochew opera. Temples 
                                often prioritize attracting larger audiences and increasing devotees, which translates to more financial 
                                support for the temple.</p></br>

                        <p>Ling Goh continues to perform Teochew puppetry and opera at cultural festivals worldwide. In 2014, she founded 
                            the Teochew Puppet & Opera House in Penang, Malaysia, showcasing exhibits of iron-rod puppets, costumes, and 
                            props. Visitors can try on opera costumes and learn puppet manipulation. The house also hosts occasional 
                            performances, workshops, and talks, preserving the legacy of Ling Goh's family of opera performers across 
                            five generations.</p></br>

                            <p>Ling Goh expresses her hope that her family's legacy will be carried on by her nephew and niece. Just as 
                                she grew up watching her mother perform, the younger generation has grown up observing their grandmother, 
                                father, and aunt on stage. The family's tradition has now become their own, with Ling Goh serving as their 
                                teacher. She eagerly anticipates their continuation of this cherished family legacy.</p>
